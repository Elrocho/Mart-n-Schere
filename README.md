# Wordpress uploader bot
> Part of freelance work

This was made for [Infolink.tv](https://infolink.tv/). It's a python script that detects new uploads from the Vimeo page
and creates entries for the wordpress site. It is currently running on a virtual maschine as a cronjob.

## What I've learned

I learned about functional programming (separating the code into different tasks/functions), python scripting and automation.
I also practiced some API-interaction and data parsing using the `requests` module.
